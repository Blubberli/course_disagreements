A1: What is the cohen's kappa between annotator a2 and a3?
---------------------------------------------------------------



A2: Why is the ICC value higher than Cohen's Kappa and Krippendorff's Alpha?
---------------------------------------------------------------



A3: Why is the percentage of agreement so high, even though the Cohen's Kappa is low?
---------------------------------------------------------------



A4: Calculate the entropy and normalized entropy for the different distributions and sort them from low to high entropy. How is it related to the agreement between the raters?
---------------------------------------------------------------




A5: Compare the two metrics for the different scenarios using the plot. How do they differ in general between scenarios? How does kappa differ from entropy?
